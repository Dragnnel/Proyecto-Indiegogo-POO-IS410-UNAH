If a Campaign Owner is unable to fulfill any of its commitments to Contributors (including delivery of any Perks), the Campaign Owner will work with the Contributors to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution, which may include refunding Contributions. Please note that if Campaign funds have been disbursed to the Campaign Owner, then it is the Campaign Owner's responsibility to issue refunds to Contributors.</p>

                <p>Indiegogo is under no obligation to become involved in disputes between Campaign Owners and Contributors, or Users and any third party. In addition, Indiegogo is under no obligation to become involved in disputes regarding the determination of the rightful Campaign Owner, and will not be obligated to make any changes to Campaign Owner accounts or transfer of ownership. In the event of any dispute, such as a Campaign Owner's alleged failure to comply with the Terms or alleged failure in fulfillment of a Perk, we may provide the Campaign Owner's contact information to the Contributor so that the two parties may resolve their dispute.</p>

                <h3>User Accounts</h3>

                <p>All information submitted in connection with a User account on the Services (each, a “<b>User Account</b>”) must be accurate and truthful. Users agree to notify Indiegogo immediately if their User Account has been used without authorization or there has been any other breach of security of the User Account. Each User also agrees to provide additional information Indiegogo may reasonably request and to answer truthfully and completely any questions Indiegogo might ask you in order to verify such User's identity.</p>

              <h3>License to Users and Use of Indiegogo Trademarks</h3>

            <h3>Campaign Owners</h3>

            <p>Campaign Owners are permitted to offer Perks to Contributors. Campaign Owners are legally bound to perform on any promise and/or commitment to Contributors (including delivering any Perks). This commitment includes shipping Perks to Indiegogo Contributors before fulfilling any orders received after the Campaign has ended. For Campaign Owners participating in programs with our retail partners, failure to ship orders to Indiegogo Contributors first may result in removal from such retail partnership programs.</p>

            <p>Campaign Owners will respond promptly and truthfully to all questions posed to them by Indiegogo or any Contributor. Campaign Owners will provide substantive and quality updates at least once a month to their Contributors. Failure to do so may result in punitive actions taken on the Campaign. If any Campaign Owner is unable to fulfill any of its commitments to Contributors (including delivering any Perks), the Campaign Owner will work with the Contributors to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution, which may include refunding their Contributions.</p>

            <p>Your location as reflected on your Campaign page must match your legal residence that you submit to Indiegogo when you create the Campaign. Campaign Owners may not create multiple Campaigns without proof of meeting fulfillment obligations from the original Campaign. Failure to adequately fulfill Campaign obligations may result in Indiegogo removing the Campaign(s) from Indiegogo, and seeking reimbursement of Campaign funds raised, including by using third-party collections services. Only the Campaign Owner shall be permitted to collect Campaign funds. Indiegogo will not be required to disburse Campaign funds to any third parties.</p>

            <p>Campaign Owners will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the use of Contributions and delivery of Perks. Campaign Owners are responsible for collecting and remitting any taxes on Contributions, and any taxes due in connection with Perks. Campaign Owners may not use a false email address to self-fund, or contribute to, their own Campaigns; this is a violation of Stripe policies and of our Terms of Use.</p>

            <p>Indiegogo may attempt to verify the identity and other information provided to us by Campaign Owners, and we may delay, withhold, reverse or refund any Contributions or other amounts without notice or liability in the event we are unable to verify any such information to our satisfaction. Campaign Owner eligibility is subject to Indiegogo’s review of the fulfillment status of prior crowdfunding obligations. Indiegogo reserves the right to prohibit or remove a Campaign if the Campaign Owner is delayed by three months or more in fulfilling a prior crowdfunding project on Indiegogo or another platform.</p>

            <p>If the amounts raised by a Campaign on Indiegogo exceed a certain threshold, and/or a Campaign has a high number of refunds or chargebacks (each as determined by Indiegogo in its sole discretion), Indiegogo may withhold a percentage of the Campaign funds for period of time as determined by Indiegogo in its discretion and in accordance with Campaign reviews.  Indiegogo will manage all refunds during this time. The minimum goal set by a Campaign Owner must be at least $500. This is applied to Campaigns with either Fixed or Flexible funding.</p>

            <p>You acknowledge that as a Campaign Owner, if you do not act in accordance with Indiegogo’s Terms, Indiegogo may obtain reimbursement of any amounts owed by a Campaign Owner to Indiegogo by holding funds from your Campaign, or from the connected Stripe or bank account associated with your Campaign, or by seeking reimbursement from the Campaign Owner by any other lawful means, including by using third-party collections services.</p>

Subject to and upon any such permission, each Campaign Owner offering any Promotion further acknowledges and agrees that: (a) such Campaign Owner shall be solely responsible for all facets of each such Promotion; (b) such Promotion does not require any Contribution or other payment of any amount as the sole method of entry into such Promotion; and (c) the official rules for such Promotion shall include clear and conspicuous language to the effect that: (i) Indiegogo does not sponsor, endorse or administer the Promotion; (ii) each participant or entrant in the Promotion releases Indiegogo from any and all liability; and (iii) all questions concerning the Promotion must be directed to the Campaign Owner and not to Indiegogo.</p>

        <h3>Third-Party Websites, Advertisers or Services</h3>

Access to or use of third-party sites or services are at each User's own risk. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, Indiegogo is not responsible for any loss or damage of any sort relating to User dealings with these third-party sites or services. We encourage Users to be aware of when they leave the Services, and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of any third-party website or service that they visit.</p>

        <h3>Payment Services</h3>
        <p>Campaigner Owners that accept PayPal and Contributors that use PayPal in connection with a Campaign acknowledge and agree to comply with PayPal’s Crowdfunding and Acceptable Use Policies. Credit card payment processing services for Campaign Owners on Indiegogo are provided by Stripe, Inc. ("<strong> Stripe</strong>") and are subject to the <a href=""> Stripe Connected Account Agreement</a>, which includes the <a href=""> Stripe Terms of Service</a> (collectively, the "<strong>Stripe Services Agreement</strong>"). By continuing to operate as a Campaign Owner on Indiegogo, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition to Indiegogo enabling credit card payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Indiegogo accurate and complete information about you and your business, and you authorize Indiegogo to share any such information with Stripe, as well as transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe.

        <h3>Chargebacks</h3>
        <p>If a chargeback is filed for a contribution to a Campaign on Indiegogo, the cardholder's financial institution will contact the payment processor for the transaction. The payment processor will then notify Indiegogo of the chargeback. Indiegogo may hold the contribution funds associated with the disputed charge until the financial institution concludes its review of the transaction.</p>

        <p>Once the financial institution concludes its review of the disputed charge and notifies Indiegogo through the payment processor, Indiegogo will comply with the decision and will either refund the disputed charge from the Campaign funds or disburse the disputed funds to the Campaign Owner.</p>

        <p>If the disputed transaction has already been disbursed to the Campaign Owner and the Campaign is in InDemand, Indiegogo will hold funds from the Campaign’s disbursement(s) to cover the cost of the chargeback. Once notified of the financial institution’s decision, Indiegogo will take appropriate the action as specified above.</p>

        <h3>Waiver and Release</h3>
        <p>For Users in a jurisdiction that requires a specific statement regarding waiver and release then the following applies. For example, California residents must, as a condition of this Agreement, waive the applicability of California Civil Code Section 1542 for unknown claims which states: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." Each User hereby waives this section of the California Civil Code and any similar provision in law, regulation or code that has the same effect or intent as the foregoing release.</p>

        <p>INDIEGOGO (INCLUDING ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUBCONTRACTORS OR LICENSORS) IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OR, IN ANY EVENT, FOR DAMAGES EXCEEDING THE LESSER OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100.00) OR THE FEES PAID TO INDIEGOGO FOR THE TRANSACTION FROM WHICH THE CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF INDIEGOGO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.</p>

        <p>For jurisdictions that do not allow Indiegogo to limit its liability: Notwithstanding any provision of the Terms, for Users in a jurisdiction that has provisions specific to waiver or liability that conflict with the foregoing, then Indiegogo's liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law. Specifically, in those jurisdictions not allowed, Indiegogo does not disclaim liability for: (a) death or personal injury caused by its negligence or that of any of its officers, employees or agents; or (b) fraudulent misrepresentation or intentional misconduct; or (c) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude either now or in the future.</p>

        <h3>Termination; Survival</h3>
        <p>Termination may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with any User Account. Users may terminate their User Account by following the instructions on the Services, but Indiegogo may retain the User Account information after termination in accordance with regulatory, accounting, and legal compliance procedures. All provisions of the Terms that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

        <h3>Governing Law</h3>
        <p>Users agree that: (a) the Services shall be deemed solely based in California (the principal place of business and corporate headquarters of Indiegogo); and (b) the Services shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Indiegogo, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles.</p>

        <h3>Arbitration and Class Action Waiver</h3>

        <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>

        <p>You and Indiegogo agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Indiegogo also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of the Platform.</p>

        <p>This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.</p>

        <p>By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with Indiegogo as follows:</p>

        <p><strong>Initial Dispute Resolution:</strong>  Most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with the Indiegogo support department <a href=""> support@indiegogo.com</a> and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>

        <p><strong>Binding Arbitration:</strong> If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including formation of the Terms or Privacy Policy, performance, and breach), the parties' relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Platform shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by AAA in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>

        <p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms or the Privacy Policy, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To commence an arbitration, you must: (a) submit a Demand for Arbitration and filing fees in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules and (b) send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to Indiegogo at 965 Mission St, 7th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103, ATTN: Legal Department.</p>

        <p><strong>Fees.</strong> To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Indiegogo will pay the additional cost of the filing fee. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Indiegogo will pay the fees invoiced by AAA, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.</p>

        <p><strong>Venue.</strong> If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in the State of California, United States of America, and you and Indiegogo agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco County, California in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. Subject to and without waiver of the arbitration provisions above, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) will be brought in and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state courts in the City and County of San Francisco, California, or federal court for the Northern District of California.</p>

        <p><strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER: ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE GENERAL TERMS WILL ONLY BE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST INDIEGOGO.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Exception: </strong>Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights ("intellectual property rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction.</p>

        <p><strong>30-Day Right to Opt Out: </strong> You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending (from the email address you use on Indiegogo) written notice of your decision to opt out to <a href="">opt-out@indiegogo.com </a> with the subject line, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT." The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Platform; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, Indiegogo also will not be bound by them.</p>

        <p><strong>Changes to This Section:</strong> Indiegogo will provide thirty (30) days' notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Indiegogo Terms of Use website, sending you a message, or otherwise notifying you when you are logged into your account. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Indiegogo Terms of Use website or sent to you..</p>

        <p>Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day.</p>

        <p><strong>Enforceability. </strong>If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class or representative arbitration).</p>

        <p><strong>Survival: </strong>This Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your Account or the Platform.</p>

        <h3>Disclaimers</h3>
        <p>Campaign Owners and other Users should be aware that many states impose charitable fund solicitation laws to guide direct or indirect fund solicitation activities in those states. While provisions vary state to state, these state laws typically include registration and reporting requirements. Indiegogo merely provides a technology platform to allow Campaign Owners to connect with Contributors. Users who access or use the Services do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with applicable law.</p>

        <p>Indiegogo makes no representations, warranties or other assertions as to the potential tax deductible status of any Contribution by a Contributor to a charitable cause or to a Campaign whose purported recipient is a recognized 501(c)(3) or other tax -advantaged organization under the Internal Revenue Code. The listing of an organization via the Services does not necessarily mean that the organization has been deemed— or remains currently deemed—a charitable or tax-advantaged organization by the Internal Revenue Service.</p>

        <h3>English Language</h3>
        <p>In the event of a conflict between these the English language version of the Terms and any foreign language translation versions thereof, the English language version of the Terms shall govern and control. All disputes, claims and causes of action (and related proceedings) will be communicated in English. Unless otherwise explicitly stated, all materials found on the Services are solely directed to individuals, companies, or other entities located in the U.S.</p>

        <h3>Export Compliance</h3>

        <p>Users agree to comply with all laws, restrictions and regulations relating to the export of products and information. For purposes of the U.S. Export Administration Act ("<strong>Export Laws</strong> "), each User states that such User is: (a) not a citizen, or otherwise located within, an embargoed nation (including without limitation the Office of Foreign Assets Control ("<strong> OFAC</strong>") comprehensively embargoed countries of Iran, Syria, Cuba, North Korea and Sudan and certain Specially Designated Nationals listed by OFAC as updated from time to time and (b) not otherwise prohibited under the Export Laws from receiving such products and information. Funds may be frozen and/or turned over to the applicable governmental enforcement agency if a Campaign is deemed to be in violation of Export Laws.</p>

        <h3>Cooperation with Authorities and Police Enforcement</h3>

        <p>We will cooperate with law enforcement authorities as required by law. We will cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any investigation of alleged illegal activity regarding the use of the Services when requested.</p>

        <h3>Notification Procedures</h3>

        <p>Users agree Indiegogo may provide notifications to such User via email, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on our website. Users may opt out of certain means of notification or to receive certain notifications.</p>

        <h3>Unsolicited Idea Submissions</h3>

        <p>We are always pleased to hear from our Users, and welcome their comments or suggestions. However, products, services, and features developed by Indiegogo or its Users might be similar or even identical to a submission received by Indiegogo or its Users. When we refer to a "submission" in this paragraph, we mean: any submission, comment, or suggestion (including, but not limited to, ideas, products, or services and suggested changes) made either on the Indiegogo platform or to Indiegogo about an existing product or service on, or a feature of, or a proposed addition to, the Indiegogo platform.</p>

          <li>(2) Indiegogo and its Users will have no express or implied obligation or liability of any kind concerning the submissions, including, for example, any use or disclosure of the submissions; and,</li>
          <li>(3) Indiegogo and its Users are entitled to unrestricted use or disclosure of the submissions for any purpose whatsoever, all without compensation to the User that submitted the submission.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Entire Agreement/Severability</h3>

        <p>These Terms are the entire agreement between each User and Indiegogo regarding its subject matter. If any provision of these Terms are deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. Indiegogo's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

        <h3>Changes to Terms</h3>
        <p>Indiegogo may alter the Terms at any time, so please review them frequently. If a material change is made, Indiegogo may notify Users in the Services, by email, by means of a notice on the Services, or other places we think appropriate. A "material change" will be determined at Indiegogo's sole discretion, in good faith, and using common sense and reasonable judgment.</p>

        <h3>DMCA Complaints</h3>
        <p>If any User believes that its copyrighted work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "<strong>DMCA</strong> ") or that any User Content infringes such User's intellectual property rights and is accessible the Services, please notify Indiegogo's Legal Department at copyright@indiegogo.com.

          <h3>Updates To This Agreement</h3>

          <p>January 18, 2008: We added prohibitions on false Project information in "Posting a Project," expanded and clarified the Fundraising Rules in "Project Fundraising," added the section "Funding Accounts," explained that Indiegogo is not responsible for Perks and modified the language relating to tax treatment of Contributions in "Contributing to a Project," and stated again that you must have the rights to post User Content in "User Content."</p>

          <p>February 6, 2008: We added the following clarification to the section titled "Contributing to Projects": "You understand that making a Contribution to a Project does not give you any rights in or to that Project, including without limitation any ownership, control, or distribution rights, and that the Project Entity shall be free to solicit other funding for the Project, enter into contracts for the Project, allocate rights in or to the Project, and otherwise direct the Project in its sole discretion. You further understand that nothing in this Agreement or otherwise limits Indiegogo's right to enter into agreements or business relationships relating to Projects."</p>

          <p>October 6, 2008: We revised the "Project Fundraising" and "Contributing to Projects" sections to state that when a Project does not meet its Campaign Goal, a contributor's options are to make the Contribution to the Project anyway, or have the Contribution returned to the Contributor's Funding Account, and to include an acknowledgment requirement for funded projects.</p>

          <p>November 21, 2008: We revised the "Project Fundraising" and "Contributing to Projects" sections to reflect the use of a third-party payment processor to handle Contribution transactions.</p>

          <p>May 7, 2009: We added the following clarification to "Project Fundraising" section: "Unless automated by the Processor, Project Funding will be disbursed from the Funding Account to the Project Entity's bank account according to the Project's disbursement details (set in the Funding section of the Project Profile). All necessary fund transfers will take place on the Friday immediately following the point the disbursement preference criteria are met."</p>

          <p>August 3, 2009: We revised the "Project Fundraising" section to clarify that the funding goal did not have to be the amount of contributions the project owner is looking to raise by the service in total but rather the amount needed to cover a specific phase of the project. We also clarified that 3rd party processing fees are removed from Project Funding upon disbursement.</p>

          <p>September 9, 2009: We revised the "Use of Our Service" section to include content creators as well as the "Project Fundraising" section to clarify a project's acknowledgement requirements if it's successful with fundraising.</p>

          <p>April 21, 2010: We revised the "Project Fundraising" section to reflect the introduction of cash rewards for achieving campaign goals and deadlines.</p>

          <p>May 6, 2010: We added the "You may not use the Service for activities that" statement to the "Use of Our Service" section.</p>

          <p>March 5, 2012: We revised the "Project Fundraising" section to reflect the latest processing times for fund transfers.</p>

          <p>July 24, 2012: We revised the "Use of Our Service" section to remove that statement that did not permit people from using our site for the sale of certain items before the seller has control or possession of the item.</p>
